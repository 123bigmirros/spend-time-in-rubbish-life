# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `README.md` describes the project purpose and editorial principles.
- `content/` holds published chapters. Current chapters live under `content/<number>.<slug>/README.md` (example: `content/1.save_life/README.md`).
- `outline/` stores planning material such as `outline/outline.md`.
- `thinking/` is an empty scratch space for future notes.
- `node_modules/` is generated by npm and should not be edited by hand.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There are no build or test scripts in `package.json` today. Typical local setup is:
- `npm install` to install the single Markdown dependency listed in `package.json`.
If you introduce tooling (linting, formatting, or build steps), add scripts to `package.json` and document them here.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Content is written in Markdown. Prefer short sections, plain language, and clear headings.
- Follow the editorial principles in `README.md`: scientific rigor, readability, and accessibility.
- Use the existing chapter naming pattern `content/<number>.<short_slug>/README.md` when adding new content.
- Keep filenames lowercase with dots or hyphens (for example, `outline/outline.md`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests are configured.
- Before opening a PR, manually review new or edited Markdown for clarity, factual accuracy, and formatting consistency.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits are short, date-style subjects (for example, `2026-1-28`). There is no strict convention, so use concise, descriptive subjects and optionally include dates.
- PRs should include: a short summary, the motivation for the change, and any outline updates if the content structure changes.
- If new chapters are added, mention the new directory path in the PR description.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Avoid committing personal data; this repository is intended for public-facing guidance.
- Keep dependencies minimal and document any new tools or scripts you add.
